# rayshader 0.10.0:

## Additions
* Add `render_camera()` function

## Changes
* Fixed some documentation issues

# rayshader 0.9.2:

## Additions
* Add additional arguments to windowsize in `plot_3d()` to specify location of viewport

# rayshader 0.9.1:

## Changes
* Fix out-of-bounds memory issue with water layer generation

# rayshader 0.9.0:

## Additions
* Added `render_snapshot` function capture and save images of the current rgl view to either file or the current device.
* Added a `pkgdown` website for the package.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.


## Changes
* Documentation updates and additions
* Updated README 

# rayshader 0.8.1: 2018-12-20
* `na.rm=FALSE` bug and `add_overlay` issue fixed
*  Fix add_overlay dimensions when no transparency layer present

# rayshader 0.8.0: 2018-12-14

## Additions

* Updated `plot_3d` to draw `NA` entries in the elevation matrix as holes in the 3D model. This can be used to slice the model into any shape.
* Updated `plot_3d` to include the new `baseshape` argument, which has several built-in shapes `c("circle","hex")` to overlay onto a matrix. This removes points in the elevation matrix outside the masked region.
* Added `lineantialias` option to `plot_3d` to allow the user to turn on antialiasing for the lines in the plot.

## Changes

* Removed `shadow_exist` and `remove_water` options from `save_3dprint` to improve robustness. User now has to remove those 3D elements themselves when creating .stl file.
* Fixed `add_overlay` when the input is a matrix
* Updated documentation for `plot_3d` with examples.
* Fixed reference to `save_png` in README

# rayshader 0.7.0: 2018-11-21

# rayshader 0.6.1: 2018-10-25
* Moved Rcpp::checkUserInterrupt() to outer loop to speed up raytracing (thanks @brodieG)

# rayshader 0.6.0: 2018-09-23

## Additions
* Added `render_depth()`, a post-processing effect to add depth of field to 3D maps.
* Added `render_water()`, which either adds or replaces a water layer on the existing 3D map.
* Added `add_overlay()`, which adds a transparent or semi-transparent overlay to the current hillshade.
* Added attribute to `montereybay` to mark it as internal data (for better user messages)

## Changes
* Changed `save_3dprint()` to include the option to remove the shadow and water layers.

# rayshader 0.5.4: 2018-09-20

* Altered coordinates of plot_map to align with the center of the grid

# rayshader 0.5.2: 2018-09-16

* Fixed aspect ratio in plot_map()

# rayshader 0.5.1: 2018-09-06

## Changes
* Fixed out-of-bounds bug in C++ normal vector generation
* `plot_map()` no longer crashes R when "rotate" is a matrix rather than a single numeric value.
* `plot_3d()` now displays warning if hillshade argument contains any values below 0 or more than 1.

# rayshader 0.5.0: 2018-08-25

## Additions
* Added `save_3dprint`, a function that exports 3D maps to a stereolithography (STL) format for 3D printing.
* Add hex logo to README

## Changes
* Fixed small overhand on 3D base.
* Changed `write_png` to `save_png`
* Corrected orientation of polygons in `plot_3d`

* Fixed lack of examples in some functions for CRAN and changed \dontrun{} calls to \donttest{}

## Changes
* Removed `remove_edges` option: the x/y dimensions of the outputs and inputs are now always consistent.

# rayshader 0.4.6: 2018-08-20

* `make_shadow` bugfix

# rayshader 0.4.5: 2018-08-17

* Added zscale argument to detect_water.

## Changes
* Changed default orientation to match the orientation of the matrix.
* Changed detect_water and calculate_normals to not show a progress bar by default.
