rayshader v0.6.1 (Release date: 2018-09-25):
================

• Moved Rcpp::checkUserInterrupt() to outer loop to speed up raytracing (thanks @brodieG)

rayshader v0.6.0 (Release date: 2018-09-22):
================

• Added `render_depth()`, a post-processing effect to add depth of field to 3D maps.

• Added `render_water()`, which either adds or replaces a water layer on the existing 3D map.

• Added `add_overlay()`, which adds a transparent or semi-transparent overlay to the current hillshade.

• Changed `save_3dprint()` to include the option to remove the shadow and water layers.

Minor change:

• Altered coordinates of plot_map to align with the center of the grid (thanks @mdsumner)

• Added attribute to `montereybay` to mark it as internal data (for better user messages)

Bug fixes:

• Fix for add_water hex color (thanks @ozjimbob)

• Fixed aspect ratio in plot_map() (thanks @mdsumner)

• Changed `write_png` to `save_png`.

• Corrected orientation of polygons in `plot_3d`

• Fixed small overhand on 3D base.

• Fixed out-of-bounds bug in C++ normal vector generation.

• `plot_map()` no longer crashes R when "rotate" is a matrix rather than a single numeric value.

• `plot_3d()` now displays warning if hillshade argument contains any values below 0 or more than 1.

• Add hex logo to README
